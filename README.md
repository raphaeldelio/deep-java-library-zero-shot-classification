# Deep Java Library Zero-Shot Classification

This project demonstrates how to use the [Deep Java Library (DJL)](https://djl.ai/) to perform zero-shot text classification with various pre-trained NLP models.

## What is Zero-Shot Classification?

Zero-shot classification is a machine learning technique that allows models to classify text into categories they haven't explicitly seen during training. This is particularly useful when you need to classify text into new or evolving categories without retraining the model.

In this project, we demonstrate how to use several pre-trained models to classify text using the zero-shot approach.

## Models Used

The project demonstrates zero-shot classification using the following models:

1. **facebook/bart-large-mnli** - A BART model fine-tuned on the Multi-Genre Natural Language Inference (MNLI) dataset
2. **DeBERTa-v3-large-mnli-fever-anli-ling-wanli** - A DeBERTa model fine-tuned on multiple NLI datasets
3. **ModernBERT-base-nli** - A BERT-based model fine-tuned for NLI tasks
4. **MoritzLaurer/bge-m3-zeroshot-v2.0** - A BGE model optimized for zero-shot classification

## Model Preparation

Models must be downloaded and converted locally using the djl-converter tool. For example:

```bash
djl-convert -m MoritzLaurer/DeBERTa-v3-large-mnli-fever-anli-ling-wanli
djl-convert -m Facebook/bart-large-mnli    
djl-convert -m MoritzLaurer/bge-m3-zeroshot-v2.0   
djl-convert -m tasksource/ModernBERT-base-nli
```

This will download the model from Hugging Face and convert it to a format that can be used by DJL.

## How It Works

The `Main.java` file demonstrates:

1. Loading different pre-trained models (both from Hugging Face Hub and local files)
2. Running zero-shot classification on a sample text: "Java is the best programming language"
3. Classifying the text into three candidate categories: "Software Engineering", "Software Programming", and "Politics"
4. Comparing the results with expected outputs to ensure consistency. Expected outputs were generated by running the models with the Python Trnasformers Library
5. Demonstrating both multi-label and single-label classification approaches

The `ZeroShotClassificationTranslator.java` file provides a custom implementation of DJL's translator interface for zero-shot classification, handling the tokenization, prediction, and post-processing of results.

## Requirements

- Java 21 or higher
- Maven

## Dependencies

The project uses the following DJL dependencies:

- `ai.djl.huggingface:tokenizers:0.32.0` - For working with Hugging Face tokenizers
- `ai.djl.pytorch:pytorch-engine:0.32.0` - The PyTorch engine for DJL
- `ai.djl:model-zoo:0.32.0` - DJL's model zoo functionality

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository
2. Ensure you have Java 21 and Maven installed
3. Run the application using Maven:

```bash
mvn compile exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="dev.raphaeldelio.Main"
```

## Expected Output

The application will run zero-shot classification on the sample text using different models and print the classification results. For each model, it will show the probability scores for each candidate label.

Example output for one model:

```
[facebook/bart-large-mnli] Classification results:
Software Programming: 0.883151
Software Engineering: 0.542319
Politics: 0.000603
```
